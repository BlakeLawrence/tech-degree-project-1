          <h2>Technology</h2>
          <p>It goes without say that I am a lover of all things tech.</p> 
          <p>I have always been a sucker for gadgets and technology is what drives some of the things I love most.</p>
            <hr class="rule">
          <h2>The Outdoors</h2>
          <p>Coming from South Africa, I was lucky enough to grow up in a city where great weather was a year round treat.</p>
          <p>I grew up camping, fishing, hiking and exploring what nature had on offer.</p>
          <p>I will always posses a strong love for the outdoors.</p>
            <hr class="rule">
          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>I fell in love with guitars at an early age when I stumbled across my fathers Jimi Hendrix record, I put it on and the rest was history.</p>
          <p>I play guitar and drums (to a very modest level unfortunately) and I love listening to all kinds of music.</p>
            <hr class="rule">
          <h2>Sports</h2>
          <p>Since I can remember, I have always been a keen sportsman. 
            <p>I grew up as a kid playing football at a local club and was always naturally a strong swimmer.</p> 
            <p>When I went to high school, I played Rugby, Cricket, Water Polo and I participated in Athletics. I also Love most ocean sports and two of my favourites are surfing and deep sea kayak fishing.</p>
